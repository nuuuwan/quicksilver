# Quicksilver

A modern React-based email client implementing the Email 2.0 vision.

- **Security & Privacy by Design**: Built-in identity, authentication, and privacy features
- **Roles & Groups**: Support for individual users, organizational roles, and temporary assignments
- **Multilingual Support**: Sinhala and Tamil language support with translation
- **Offline-First**: Reliable functionality even with flaky connectivity
- **Smart Organization**: AI-powered categorization beyond folders and labels
