# Email 2.0

**Email 2.0** is my (@nuuuwan) attempt at reimagining email, as something that is an order of magnitude more productive and more user-friendly than "Email 1.0" (what we have now).

I have sorted my ideas into three priority groups.

## User Experience

### High Priority

*Must have in base release.*

- **Many use cases of SMS, Social Media Messaging and various "Productivity Apps", should be part of Email.**
  - A mobile email app that can compete with WhatsApp in terms of simplicity and ease-of-use.
  - Conversational UI & Threads

- **"Security by Design" and "Privacy by Design" and "Identity by Design".**

- **Users, User Roles and Groups are integrated into email.** Some emails are for individual users (Nuwan), while others are for Roles (Manager of Bank of Ceylon, Maradana), some of which might be temporary (Chief Organizer of 2025 Conference).

- **Sinhala and Tamil Language support** – Basic Translation to start with.

- **Offline Access** (assume that internet will be down or flaky some of the time)

- **Search** (that is dependable)

### Medium Priority

*Expectations set that this will be happening in the medium term.*

- **While attaching files is a common part of email, the technology for doing this is not tightly integrated.** Attachments are not "first class citizens" of email.
  - Ditto Calendars
  - Ditto Tasks
  - Ditto Forms. "Fill this form and email it to"

- **"Email between Agents" as opposed to "Email between Humans"**
  - Custom Workflows (e.g. "If about X, then forward to Y")

- **Document Authentication and Signing.** An email from Nuwan should be equivalent to a document signed by Nuwan, or Nuwan should have the option of signing any email.

- **Folders are a poor way of organizing emails.** Tags/Labels are a little better. But an even better way is needed. AI-powered categorization might be a way forward. AI-powered topic tagging?

- **Smart Summary of Email Threads & Other AI Reductions**

- **Scheduled Emails & Un-Send**

### Low Priority

*Something we might get to, especially if the development community has some interest in designing & building this.*

- **Expectations on when email should be answered,** from both sender and receiver.

- **Validity periods for emails (TTL)** and appropriate behavior for particular patterns

- **Analytics on Email Use and Productivity**

- **Collaboration on Documents**
